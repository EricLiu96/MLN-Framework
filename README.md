# MLN-Framework
This is a step-by-step multi-layers neural network tutorial. We use python as our language. Two editions will be denoted, **jupyter notebook** and a **.py file**.

### Comment Rule
Every time you commit a new modification or a new file, add the comment in this way **<your-name> Verb to Which File**.

For example, using `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "<your-name> Verb to Which File" 
```
